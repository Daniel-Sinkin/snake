# Introduction
This is a simple snake game written in with pygame and the modernGL library for OpenGL. While a relatively simple project it is intended to be a learning experience when it comes to OpenGL and more importantly in actually finishing projects.

# Retrospective
While nowhere near releaseable the game is in a state that I'd call it a successful tech demo and  that is good enough for a project, the goal was not to have a perfectly polished product but to have a project and run it from start to finish.

## Key Learnings
* I've increased my fluency when working with shaders and gained a more sophisticated understanding of how they work and how to use them
* I've grown to appreciate the VAO pipeline, especially with the amount of boilerplate that one has to use to set multiple objects up, will need to think of a good pipeline.
* I've started using a kanban system for this project and will stick to those, it's much less overhead than using a seperate Jira board or something like that.
